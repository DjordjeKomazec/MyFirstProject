						<p class="wow fadeInDown">Apart from being no 1 when it comes to nightlife and hospitality of its citizens, there is so much you do not know about White City! Did you know that the whole underground city lies beyond the famous landmark of the city, Kalemegdan fortress? What's more, facts say that it's not only under the fortress, but also under the whole historical part of the city center? One of the tours we offer includes visit to major underground sites in the Belgrade fortress, such as Roman Well, Barutana and Army Bunker! And that's not all! Stories you will hear will make you go back in time and visualize how it used to be in the past! From the fortress to the banks of the rivers! Another "must" is a cruise on the Sava and Danube rivers! We suggest to do it during sunset because the impression you get will be unforgettable! We will take you to visit major highlights of the city, such as Temple of Saint Sava, Saint Michael church, House of Flowers, Kneza Miloša street, Terazije and Slavija Square and much more! There is also a large choice of museums, and we can make you a tailor-made tour which will make you experience the visit in an authentic and unique way! One of them is certainly Nikola Tesla tour! But enough of the talk, let's start the adventure together! </p>
